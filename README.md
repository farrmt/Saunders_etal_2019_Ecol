#### Abstract: 
A common challenge for studying wildlife populations occurs when different observation methods (e.g. mark-recapture, census, telemetry, occupancy) provide inconsistent or incomplete inference on the trend, dynamics, or viability of a population. A potential solution to the challenge of conflicting or piecemeal data (i.e. dataset discrepancies and deficiencies, respectively) relies on the integration of multiple data types into a unified modeling framework, such as integrated population models (IPMs). IPMs are a powerful approach for species that inhabit spatially and seasonally complex environments. In cases where data come from heterogeneous collection schemes, individual data sources are unlikely to contain all the information necessary to model large-scale population dynamics, and may fail to capture spatial and temporal variability across a species’ range or annual cycle. We review how data discrepancies can be modeled with IPMs and provide guidance on combining multiple data types when there are data deficiencies. We illustrate this issue with analysis of a migratory species, the American woodcock (Scolopax minor), in which individual monitoring programs suggest differing population trends. To address this discrepancy, we synthesized several long-term datasets (1963 – 2015) within an IPM to estimate continental-scale population trends, and link dynamic drivers across the full annual cycle and complete extent of the woodcock’s geographic range in eastern North America. Our analyses reveal the limiting portions of the life cycle by identifying time periods (i.e. seasons) and locations (i.e. population units) where survival rates are lowest and most variable, as well as which demographic parameters constitute the main drivers of population change. We provide recommendations for exploiting the capabilities of IPMs to account for incongruent datasets and discuss how strategies (e.g. data weighting, data thinning) from other disciplines can be incorporated into ecological analyses that combine multiple, disparate data types.
