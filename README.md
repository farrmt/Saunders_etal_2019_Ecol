This is a repository for an American woodcock integrated population model. It is a work in progress by members of the Zipkin Lab for the  Reproducible Quantitative Methods course.

**| What |**

*Description:* This project uses existing banding, band recovery, harvest, and survey data (1963-2012) 
to develop an integrated population model for Eastern and Central Region woodcock populations. 
The synthesis and modeling of this data will help identify limiting components of the woodcock 
population cycle by identifying time periods and locations where population growth is most limited.

*Title:* Timberdoodle IPM (Integrated Population Model)

*Permanent Identifier (e.g. DOI):* Work still in progress, permanent identified is to be determined.

*Data Source:* Harvest data and singing ground survey data from public sites (include here). Banding data  
obtained at request from Bird Banding Lab.

This project utilizes 3 datasets:  

1) Banding-Recovery Data  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: Bird banding is a universal technique for studying the movement, survival and behavior of birds. Recovery data is also useful for estimating survival rates of both young and adult birds.

2) Hunter Harvest Data  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: The U.S. Harvest Information Program (HIP) measures hunter effort and number of woodcocks harvested by hunters annually (1963-Present).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact: USFWS Migratory Bird Data Center  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Website: https://migbirdapps.fws.gov/

3) Singing Ground Survey  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: Survey of numerous routes throughout the range of woodcocks to survey singing males during the spring.
